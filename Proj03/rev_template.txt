<instructions> In the context of the five rewiew elements, please evalute the strengths and weaknesses of the proposal with respect to intellectual merit.
The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:
    1. What is the potential for the proposed activity to
    a. advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or
    across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and
    b. benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?
    2. To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore
    creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?
    3. Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned,
    well- organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan
    incorporate a mechanism to assess success?
    4. How well qualified is the individual, team, or institution to conduct
    the proposed activities?
    5. Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home
    institution or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?
