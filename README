    Proposal Reviewing Tool
    Basic Instructions

    (C) Blake Hannaford  June 2016
     rev 1.1  Oct 2017
     rev 1.2  Oct 2020

System Requirements:

This package requires python with the Tkinter/ttk packages installed.

The package has been developed and tested in Ubuntu linux.  It might work on
Windows or Mac as well.

PDF reader:   the code defaults to using acroread to display PDFs.  To change
to your favorite PDF reader, search for 'acroread' in PRT.py and change it to
whatever you like.

Usage:

The use case is to receive a package of research proposals as .pdfs to review
as well as a template for the written critique and criteria for numerical
scoring.   All materials related to a given review project are contained in a
project folder or directory you must set up prior to using the tool.   There are
three supplied example project folders:

        Proj01:      An absolute minimal folder
        Proj02:      An NIH style example
        Proj03:      An NSF style example

There are two key files which must appear in your project folder.


 1) apps.csv

The first line of apps.csv is

Due Date: 1-Nov-2020

(edit for your due date)

You can generate and export this in a spreadsheet.  There are
four fields (columns) for each proposal:

 ID, Title, PI, Institution

The ID should be the official proposal number (sometimes the filename of the proposal's PDF minus the
.pdf extension).    Example:

Due Date: 1-Nov-2020
1R42xuzlkjer-01, Black holes at the center of the earth, Einstein A., Berlin Patent Office
2R43asdkrurc-01, Effect of sensor noise on estimation of surgical tasks, King, D., University of South Texas

etc etc

For NIH it is good to use the full prefix: "1R43" "2R01" etc.    The app will decode and display meaning of these if it recognizes them. 

 2) rev_template.txt

This is based on the review specifications from the sponsor.  There are example
files in "templates/", below the distribution directory:

        rev_template_NSF_June16.txt   for NSF proposals
        rev_template_NIH_June16.txt   for NIH proposals

Copy one of these into your project folder and rename it rev_template.txt.  You will
probably need to edit for each project it since agencies frequency change
or specialize their criteria.

Then copy or download the proposal pdfs into your project folder.   The file
names must match the 'ID's in apps.csv.

Example:

    ID = 'R21 EY123456-01'       filename 'R21 EY123456-01.pdf'

Finally, run it:

    >python PRT.py Proj02    (where Proj02 is your project name)


Hopefully the GUI is self explanatory.    The top row operates on proposals.
Select your proposal with the up/down arrows or mousing the menu.  'View' opens
the pdf.   The final two buttons output your review as a text file, and outputs
your scores as a spreadheet respectively. The next row identifies the current
proposal details.

Next you select a Criterion, response field, and score (when enabled).    To the
right you can add a couple of frequently used responses.

Type your text into the window for each Criterion and field.  Whenever you
change criteria/fields and the text is changed, your entire review is
automatically saved.

A status bar shows you total character count for the review (coming soon, other progress
measures)

At the bottom, you can save the current proposal or quit.

Note that after you start reviewing you cannot change your apps.csv or template.txt files, PRT.py will get
confused.

### New: Conflict of Interest checking tool.   

1. Sponsor sends you a password protected PDF containing all proposal investigators and affiliations.
2. Document your personal relationships in a `.csv` file.
2. run `>python3 coi_checker.py` to check for any matching names with your personal relationships.

### New: Graphically review your progress:

1. Click the new "Progress Graph" button
2. Run >python2 comp_radar.py
